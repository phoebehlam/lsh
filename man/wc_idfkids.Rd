\examples{
# Example: 10-year-old boy, WC = 78 cm, all-race cutoff
wc_idfkids(age = 10, sex = "male", wc = 78)

# Example: 10-year-old Black boy, WC = 78 cm
wc_idfkids(age = 10, sex = "male", wc = 78, race = "black")

# Example: 12-year-old Latina girl, WC = 80 cm
wc_idfkids(age = 12, sex = "female", wc = 80, race = "latino")

# Example: 15-year-old girl, WC = 93 cm, unspecified race (defaults to all)
wc_idfkids(age = 15, sex = "female", wc = 93)
